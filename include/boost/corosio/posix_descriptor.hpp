/* Adoption of an already-open pollable POSIX descriptor.

   The two contract points that are not obvious from the
   declarations:

   assign() validates before it mutates. A fd rejected by validation
   leaves the object holding whatever it held before, pending
   operations included, and leaves ownership of the fd with the
   caller. A kernel registration refusal is the one exception: it
   happens after the old descriptor has already been closed, so the
   object is left closed.

   O_NONBLOCK is applied lazily, at the first read_some/write_some,
   and never restored. A wait()-only user never triggers it, which
   is what makes adopting STDIN_FILENO safe: flipping the flag would
   change the parent shell's terminal, because the flag lives on the
   shared open file description, not on the descriptor.
*/

namespace boost::corosio {

/** An adopted POSIX descriptor for coroutine I/O.

    Wraps an already-open pollable file descriptor -- a character
    device, `inotify`, `eventfd`, `timerfd`, `pidfd`, a pipe, a tty,
    or a socket kind corosio does not otherwise wrap -- and drives it
    from the `io_context`. The descriptor must come from the caller;
    this type never creates one.

    The type name is deliberately platform-qualified. Portability
    comes from the interfaces it implements, not from the name: a
    `posix_descriptor` is an @ref io_stream, so `capy::read`,
    `capy::write`, other `capy::Stream`-constrained algorithms and
    TLS layering work on it exactly as they do on a socket.

    @par Ownership
    `assign()` takes ownership and `close()` will close the
    descriptor. To integrate with a library that owns the fd, adopt
    a `dup()` of it: readiness lives on the open file description,
    which both descriptors share.

    @par Descriptor Flags
    `assign()` and `wait()` never modify the descriptor. The first
    `read_some()` or `write_some()` sets `O_NONBLOCK` and never
    restores it -- the flag lives on the shared open file
    description, so restoring it would race every other holder. A
    `dup()` is no escape: the duplicate shares that same description,
    so the flag change reaches the other holder anyway. When another
    party owns the descriptor and cannot tolerate `O_NONBLOCK`, use
    `wait()` -- which never modifies the descriptor -- and do the I/O
    yourself.

    @par Rejected Descriptors
    Regular files, block devices and directories are rejected with
    `errc::operation_not_supported`: @ref stream_file and
    @ref random_access_file adopt those. Where a kernel refusal
    surfaces depends on the backend: epoll, kqueue and select
    register the descriptor during `assign()`, so a refusal fails
    there -- on select that is `EMFILE` for `fd >= FD_SETSIZE` --
    while io_uring has no adopt-time registration, so `assign()`
    succeeds and takes ownership and the refusal appears at the
    first `read_some()` or `write_some()`. An `assign()`-time
    refusal is the one failure that does not preserve the previously
    held descriptor: it has already been closed by then, and the
    object is left closed.

    @par Signals
    Writing to a descriptor whose peer has closed raises `SIGPIPE`
    in the default disposition -- unlike the socket types, which
    suppress it. `MSG_NOSIGNAL` is a `send()` flag with no `writev`
    equivalent, and `SO_NOSIGPIPE` is a socket option, so neither
    applies to an arbitrary descriptor. Callers must install
    `SIG_IGN` for `SIGPIPE` if that is not already the process's
    disposition.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. A descriptor must not have concurrent
    operations of the same type (e.g. two simultaneous reads). One
    read and one write may be in flight simultaneously.
