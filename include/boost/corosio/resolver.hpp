/** Resolves host names and services to endpoints, from a coroutine.

    This class provides asynchronous DNS resolution operations that return
    awaitable types. Each operation participates in the affine awaitable
    protocol, ensuring coroutines resume on the correct executor.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. A resolver must not have concurrent resolve
    operations.

    @par Semantics
    Wraps platform DNS resolution (`getaddrinfo`/`getnameinfo`).
    Operations dispatch to OS resolver APIs via the `io_context`
    thread pool.

    @par !example resolver
