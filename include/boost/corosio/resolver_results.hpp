    full `std::vector` interface (iteration, `size()`, `empty()`, etc.).

    entry owns two `std::string`s (the host and service names). Some
    sinks take the range by value, such as `corosio::connect`. To avoid
    the copy, pass an rvalue (`std::move(results)`) or use the
    iterator-based `connect` overloads.
