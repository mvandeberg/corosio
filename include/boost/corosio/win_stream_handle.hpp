/** Drives an already-open overlapped Windows handle from an `io_context`.

    Wraps a handle with an implicit position: the server or client
    end of a named pipe opened with `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`, a COM
    port, or a mailslot. The handle must come from the caller; this
    type never creates one.

    The type name is deliberately platform-qualified. Portability
    comes from the interfaces it implements, not from the name. A
    `win_stream_handle` is an @ref io_stream, so `capy::read`,
    `capy::write`, other `capy::Stream`-constrained algorithms and
    TLS layering work on it exactly as they do on a socket.

    There is no `wait()`. IOCP has no readiness primitive for
    arbitrary handles, which is the reason this type is not a
    portable one.

    @par Ownership
    `assign()` takes ownership and `close()` closes the handle.
    `release()` detaches it from this context's completion port and
    hands it back, or throws and keeps it while an operation is
    still in flight.

    While the handle is bound to a completion port, every overlapped
    call on it queues a packet to that port. Do not issue your own
    overlapped I/O on it (`ConnectNamedPipe`, `WaitCommEvent`,
    `DeviceIoControl`) unless the `OVERLAPPED`'s `hEvent` has its
    low-order bit set, which suppresses the packet. Connect a pipe
    server before `assign()`.

    @par Rejected Handles
    Console handles, handles opened without `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`
    (including both ends of an anonymous `CreatePipe` pipe), disk
    files and directories are rejected with
    `errc::operation_not_supported`. A named pipe created with
    `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` is the substitute for `CreatePipe`;
    @ref stream_file adopts disk files. A handle already bound to
    another completion port fails with `errc::invalid_argument`.

    @par Transfers
    Each `read_some()` and `write_some()` transfers at most the first
    buffer of the sequence. On a message-mode pipe, a message longer
    than the buffer is returned across successive reads. A read that
    finds the peer closed completes with `capy::error::eof`; a write
    completes with `errc::broken_pipe`. On a message-mode pipe, a
    zero-length message reads as eof, and a zero-length write sends
    nothing.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. One read and one write may be in flight
    simultaneously; two reads (or two writes) may not.

    @par Example
    @par !example win_stream_handle
