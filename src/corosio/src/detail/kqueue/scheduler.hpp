/** macOS/BSD scheduler using kqueue for I/O multiplexing.

    This scheduler implements the scheduler interface using the BSD kqueue
    API for efficient I/O event notification. It uses a single reactor model
    where one thread runs kevent() while other threads
    wait on a condition variable for handler work. This design provides:

    - Handler parallelism: N posted handlers can execute on N threads
    - No thundering herd: condition_variable wakes exactly one thread
    - IOCP parity: Behavior matches Windows I/O completion port semantics

    When threads call run(), they first try to execute queued handlers.
    If the queue is empty and no reactor is running, one thread becomes
    the reactor and runs kevent(). Other threads wait on a condition
    variable until handlers are available.

    kqueue uses EV_CLEAR for edge-triggered semantics (equivalent to
    epoll's EPOLLET). File descriptors are registered once with both
    EVFILT_READ and EVFILT_WRITE and stay registered until closed.

    @par Thread Safety
    All public member functions are thread-safe.
